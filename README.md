Hello, This is my Github, I am still developing it until it really is representing me, however, I am human and I keep changing because I am alive.
So I am still thinking about how can AI be aware of how we change? so to reflect that in the e-space...
HCI is a subject that I love to explore...
I have 3 Awesome kids whom I Love unconditionally, apparently loving yourself and others is most of the time conditional...

Do you remember Neo? I guess the green fun above might ring the bell...
